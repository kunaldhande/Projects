CS579: Assignment 0
Collecting a political social network

In this assignment, I've given you a list of Twitter accounts of 4
U.S. presedential candidates.

The goal is to use the Twitter API to construct a social network of these
accounts. We will then use the [networkx](http://networkx.github.io/) library
to plot these links, as well as print some statistics of the resulting graph.

1. Create an account on [twitter.com](http://twitter.com).
2. Generate authentication tokens by following the instructions [here](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/auth/tokens-devtwittercom).
3. Add your tokens to the key/token variables below. (API Key == Consumer Key)
4. Be sure you've installed the Python modules
[networkx](http://networkx.github.io/) and
[TwitterAPI](https://github.com/geduldig/TwitterAPI). Assuming you've already
installed [pip](http://pip.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installing.html), you can
do this with `pip install networkx TwitterAPI`.

OK, now you're ready to start collecting some data!

I've provided a partial implementation below. Your job is to complete the
code where indicated.  You need to modify the 10 methods indicated by
#TODO.

Your output should match the sample provided in Log.txt.
